For the second part of the first assignment i have to choose a project to make during this semester.
I want to make a remote controll for my blinds. Fitures I want are: top and bottom part moving separatly.
The ability to control it from a the internet.

My basic plan is to have 2 belts on each side. One to contol the top part and one to control the bottom. To not end up needing 4 motors I want to use a gearbox, with the ability to drive 2 of the belts. All controlled from a Arduino. 
![ADA525_forrprosjekt.pdf](maxthyes/Downloads/ADA525_forrprosjekt.pdf).

Fot this i will need:
2 Motors
2 Servos, controlling outputs.
2 Gearboxes.
4 Belts.
1 Arduino with wifi.

The biggest challenge i see for ths project is to design the gearbox.
